This page covers the specifics of Supply Lanes and does not cover the more general aspects of Lanes. For more general information about lanes, see the [Lane]({% link _rust-server/lanes.md %}) page.

# Overview

A Supply Lane is a stateless analogue of a [Value Lane]({% link _rust-server/value-lanes.md %}). Instead of maintaining a persistent state that can be queried, a Supply Lane is simply fed a value to propagate. A Supply Lane meets the following requirements:

- Values are supplied to the lane by calling the [Handler Context's]({% link _rust-server/handler-context.md %}) `supply` function.
- The supplied value will be sent to all attached uplinks.

Supply Lanes are similar to [Demand Value Lanes]({% link _rust-server/demand-value-lanes.md %}) and [Demand Map Lanes]({% link _rust-server/demand-map-lanes.md %}) but do not expose a lifecycle event handler. This changes the scope of where a value can be supplied to the lane. With a demand-type handler, the value is typically produced inside the lane's registered lifecycle event handler. Whereas with a Supply Lane, the value may be produced inside another handler.

Supply Lanes are ideal for publishing statistical events, where it isnâ€™t important that a client receives every incremental update, only that the client eventually receives the latest state, that the state clients receive is real-time (within the latency of the network), and that updates are desired as often as possible. `supply` invocations may happen at scheduled intervals (using timers) or after another event has been triggered by an agent (such as after another lane receives an update and its lifecycle event handler invokes `supply`).

The following example demonstrates using a Supply Lane as well as how the same functionality would look using a Demand Lane:

```rust
use swimos::agent::event_handler::HandlerAction;
use swimos::agent::lanes::{DemandLane, SupplyLane};
use swimos::agent::{
    agent_lifecycle::utility::HandlerContext,
    event_handler::{EventHandler, HandlerActionExt},
    lanes::ValueLane,
    lifecycle, projections, AgentLaneModel,
};

#[derive(AgentLaneModel)]
#[projections]
pub struct ExampleAgent {
    lane: ValueLane<i32>,
    supply: SupplyLane<i32>,
    demand: DemandLane<i32>,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct ExampleLifecycle;

#[lifecycle(ExampleAgent)]
impl ExampleLifecycle {
    #[on_event(lane)]
    pub fn on_event(
        &self,
        context: HandlerContext<ExampleAgent>,
        value: &i32,
    ) -> impl EventHandler<ExampleAgent> {
        let n = *value;
        context
            .supply(ExampleAgent::SUPPLY, n * 2)
            .followed_by(context.cue(ExampleAgent::DEMAND))
    }

    #[on_cue(demand)]
    pub fn on_cue(
        &self,
        context: HandlerContext<ExampleAgent>,
    ) -> impl HandlerAction<ExampleAgent, Completion = i32> {
        context.get_value(ExampleAgent::LANE).map(|n| 2 * n)
    }
}
```

# Use cases

Supply Lanes are suitable for situations where you aren't interested in the data immediately and can handle the delay between linking to the lane and the `supply` invocation. Common usecases are:

- Propagating metadata. Metadata may be propagated at set intervals using the [Handler Context's]({% link _rust-server/handler-context.md %}) timer API and calculated on-demand.
- Generating data on-demand using [Command Lanes]({% link _rust-server/command-lanes.md %}). A Command Lane may react to a command and invoke the `supply` function to return a response.
- Propagating a subset of data. A Demand Lane may generate a subset of data from the state of another lane and propagate this to linked peers rather than duplicating the state of a lane. The lane's superset may invoke the `supply` operation after its state changes to avoid this duplication.

# Event handler

No lifecycle event handler is provided for a Supply Lane. Values are fed to the lane using the [Handler Context's]({% link _rust-server/handler-context.md %}) `supply` function.

# Handler Context Operations

The `HandlerContext` provided as an argument to lifecycle event handlers provide a `supply` function for feeding a value to the Supply Lane. An example client which uses a Supply Lane for pushing log events:

```rust
use swimos::agent::lanes::SupplyLane;
use swimos::agent::{
    agent_lifecycle::utility::HandlerContext,
    event_handler::{EventHandler, HandlerActionExt},
    lanes::ValueLane,
    lifecycle, projections, AgentLaneModel,
};
use swimos_form::Form;

#[derive(Form, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct LogEntry {
    message: String,
}

#[derive(AgentLaneModel)]
#[projections]
pub struct ExampleAgent {
    state: ValueLane<i32>,
    logs: SupplyLane<LogEntry>,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct ExampleLifecycle;

#[lifecycle(ExampleAgent)]
impl ExampleLifecycle {
    #[on_event(state)]
    pub fn on_event(
        &self,
        context: HandlerContext<ExampleAgent>,
        value: &i32,
    ) -> impl EventHandler<ExampleAgent> {
        let n = *value;
        context.supply(
            ExampleAgent::LOGS,
            LogEntry {
                message: format!("{n}"),
            },
        )
    }
}
```

# Subscription

A subscription to a Supply Lane can only be achieved via an [Event Downlink]({% link _rust-server/event-downlinks.md %}). A client for the previous agent example:

```rust
use swimos_client::{BasicValueDownlinkLifecycle, DownlinkConfig, RemotePath, SwimClientBuilder};
use swimos_form::Form;

#[derive(Form, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct LogEntry {
    message: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (client, task) = SwimClientBuilder::default().build().await;
    let _client_task = tokio::spawn(task);
    let handle = client.handle();

    let log_path = RemotePath::new("ws://0.0.0.0:52284", "/example/1", "logs");
    let log_lifecycle = BasicValueDownlinkLifecycle::default()
        .on_event_blocking(|log: &LogEntry| println!("{log:?}"));
    let _log_downlink = handle
        .event_downlink::<LogEntry>(log_path)
        .lifecycle(log_lifecycle)
        .downlink_config(DownlinkConfig::default())
        .open()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to open downlink");

    let state_path = RemotePath::new("ws://0.0.0.0:52284", "/example/1", "state");
    let state_downlink = handle
        .value_downlink::<i32>(state_path)
        .downlink_config(DownlinkConfig::default())
        .open()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to open downlink");

    for i in 0..10 {
        state_downlink.set(i).await.unwrap()
    }

    tokio::signal::ctrl_c()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to listen for ctrl-c.");
}

```
