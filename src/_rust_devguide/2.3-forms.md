SwimOS uses a lightweight encoding and decoding system for transcoding types between a SwimOS [Value]({% link _rust_backend/value.md %}) instance for communication between agents and a lane's type. Any type parameters used by a Lane must implement the [Form]({% link _rust_backend/forms.md %}) trait which defines how a type is transcoded; `Form` is a supertrait formed of `StructuralReadable` (for decoding) and `StructuralWritable` (for encoding).

The aforementioned traits are implemented for most of the standard library that Serde's `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits are implemented for and for most types simply annotating a struct or enum with `#[derive(Form)]` will suffice but for more complex types implementations may have to be manually defined. See [Form]({% link _rust_backend/forms.md %}) for more information.
