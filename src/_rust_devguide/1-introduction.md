Welcome to the SwimOS developer's guide, an introductory guide to the SwimOS framework.
With SwimOS, you can dive into building applications without getting bogged down by intricate infrastructure details – it takes care of the 'plumbing' so you can concentrate on crafting robust application logic.

In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts and practical aspects of SwimOS, focusing on its features.
Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and skills to harness the full potential of SwimOS for developing real-time applications.
While we'll cover the 'how' of building streaming apps, if you're interested in understanding the 'why' behind it, you may find our reference documentation more insightful.

# Who This Guide Is For

This guide assumes that you've written code in Java before, as such we will not explain any Java specific features or syntax.
We will focus on features of the SwimOS framework which by design aren't overly complex to use, although some background knowledge of software development technologies is required.
