To initiate the setup of a SwimOS project, start by creating and navigating to the directory where it will be located. First, lets start by creating a new server project named `server`:

```shell
cargo new server --bin
```

Then we need to declare our dependencies. Let's start by adding the following to our `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
swimos = "{{ site.data.rust-crates.swimos-version }}"
swimos_client = "{{ site.data.rust-crates.swimos-client-version }}"
tokio = { "{{ site.data.rust-crates.tokio-version }}", features = ["full"] }
```

The SwimOS platform is built using the `tokio` runtime so we need to include it.

Lets add the required imports for our example application to the `main.rs` file:

```rust
use swim::{
    agent::{
        agent_lifecycle::utility::HandlerContext,
        agent_model::AgentModel,
        event_handler::{EventHandler, HandlerActionExt},
        lanes::ValueLane,
        lifecycle, projections, AgentLaneModel,
    },
    route::RoutePattern,
    server::{Server, ServerBuilder, ServerHandle},
};
```

Now lets add our client project named `client`:

```shell
cargo new client --bin
```

Then we need to declare our dependencies in our `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
swimos_client = "{{ site.data.rust-crates.swimos-client-version }}"
tokio = { "{{ site.data.rust-crates.tokio-version }}", features = ["full"] }
```

Lets add the required imports for our example application to the `main.rs` file:

```rust
use client::{BasicValueDownlinkLifecycle, DownlinkConfig, RemotePath, SwimClientBuilder};
use std::str::FromStr;
```

The Minimum Supported Rust Version is 1.76.0.
