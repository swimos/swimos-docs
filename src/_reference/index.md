Get up to speed with SwimOS concepts to build streaming data applications. The concepts listed here form the basis of all SwimOS apps.

Some concepts have a corresponding [cookbook](https://github.com/swimos/cookbook) with working examples. Please see the [README](https://github.com/swimos/cookbook/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to run these projects.
