## Build Apps with Ease

Swim applications are comprised of stateful web agents, which represent real-world objects, and streamlets, bits of application logic which continuously analyze streaming inputs, update their own state, and stream output over their links to other streamlets or to users and applications. By combining web agents and streamlets, Swim developers can quickly model even the most complex real-world systems, processes and environments.

## Example Apps

To try Swim, check out an example application, like Ripple, Traffic, Transit. Or clone a [starter application](https://github.com/swimos/tutorial) on which to base a new app.

### Ripple

Ripple is a real-time synchronous shared multiplayer experience built on the Swim platform

- [Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/swimos/ripple)
- [Download a zip](https://github.com/swimos/ripple/archive/master.zip)

### Traffic

Traffic processes 30,000 data points per second from connected traffic intersections

### Transit

Transit analyzes application performance to deliver continuous insights in real-time

### Cookbooks

Cookbook examples are real-world examples of SwimOS concepts in action.
