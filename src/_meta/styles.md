## TailwindCSS

We use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to apply styles to this site.

### TailwindCSS Config & Theme

Our theme colors and configuration can be found in `tailwind.config.js`. TailwindCSS includes a default base configurations but it can be overidden here.

```javascript
...
theme: {
      extend: {
        fontFamily: {
          'sans': ['"Sora"', 'sans-serif']
        },
        colors: {
          'vermillion-orange': '#FE3B1E',
          'deep-kaimurasaki': '#221C34',
          'magenta': '#D2007D',
          'deep-magenta': '#740049',
          'eggshell': '#F0E5D0',
          'alabastor': '#FCF9EC'
        },
      },
    },
...
```

## Theme Templates

In addition to the TailwindCSS theme config, template files are located in several places in the project.

```
- swimos-docs # Project root
  - _includes/ # Theme components/small templates
  - _layouts/ # Page layouts
  - assets/ # Asset directory
    - css/
    - images/
    - js/
  - 404.html # Top level HTML pages live in the project root.
  - community.html
  - index.html # https://swimos.org index page
```

Template files are raw HTML with [Liquid template](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) syntax sprinkled in to render pages.

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents on each document page is generated by the [jekyll-toc](https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc) plugin.

### TOC Styles

The TOC is styled in `_config.yml`. We use TailwindCSS classes to style it, but you can also create your own styles for classes generated by the plugin.

```yaml
# _config.yml
toc:
  list_id: toc # id of the <ul> for the toc
  list_class: mt-1 px-2 # We use TailwindCSS classes but you can also create your own
  sublist_class: '' # We use TailwindCSS classes but you can also create your own
  item_class: hover:text-vermillion-orange block rounded-md py-2 pr-2 pl-9 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-700 # You guessed it, more TailwindCSS classes.
  item_prefix: toc- # Adds a toc-* class to each list item for styling. Ex. toc-h2 for list items that refer to an h2 in the doc body.
```

You can learn more about styling the TOC in the [jekyll-toc README](https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc#css-styling){:data-proofer-ignore=''}

## Callouts & Alerts

### Alerts

You can add alert callouts to any document by including the `alert.html` template located at `_includes/alert.html`.

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include alert.html title='Caution' text='This is the alert body text. You can use <strong>HTML</strong> markup in it to add emphasis.' %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% include alert.html title='Caution' text='This is the alert body text. You can use <strong>HTML</strong> markup in it to add emphasis.' %}

### Cookbook Banner

If `cookbook:` is set in a page's [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/), a banner will render to tell readers that 
a cookbook example exists and will link them to the cookbook repo. This banner is located in `_includes/cookbook.html` and is included in `_layouts/page.html` only if `page.cookbook` is set.

{% include cookbook.html %}

## Announcement Banner

An announcement banner can be toggled on and off via `_config.yml`. **All options are required to be set for the banner to render properly.**

- `display:` Set this to `true` to display the banner or `false` to hide it.
- `cta: ` Set a call to action. Make this exciting!
- `text:` This is the announcement body. Keep it short and sweet.
- `cta-link:` Renders the banner with a link. This could be a blog post, event signup, or some other site.

**When developing locally, you will need to stop and re-start the Jekyll server to see changes.**

```yaml
# Set display to true/false to toggle announcements on/off
# If developing locally, this requires a jekyll serve restart to test.
announcement:
  display: true
  cta: "Join us at StreamCon 2023!"
  text: "We'll be at booth #9001."
  cta-link: "https://nstream.io/"
```

The template for this banner can be found in `_includes/banner.html`.

## "Prose" styles for Markdown

Tailwind CSS has a [Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) plugin that implements [`prose`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin#basic-usage) classes with default styles. This is useful for rendering Markdown content so that we don't have to style every block through `tailwind.config.js`.

### Paragraph Lead

<p class="lead">This is an example of a paragraph lead.</p>

You can use this to add emphasis to the opening word or sentence of a paragraph to highlight a main point.

### Horizontal Rule

<hr />

### Blockquote

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a really important quote from someone you should listen to.
  </p>
</blockquote>

### Table

<table>
  <caption class="caption-top">
    Table 3.1: Professional wrestlers and their signature moves.
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Wrestler</th>
      <th>Signature Move(s)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</td>
      <td>Stone Cold Stunner, Lou Thesz Press</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bret "The Hitman" Hart</td>
      <td >The Sharpshooter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Razor Ramon</td>
      <td>Razor's Edge, Fallaway Slam</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Code Blocks

#### Inline Code

You can render inline code snippets by using `<code></code>` tags or `backticks`:

"This is a <code>className</code>."

This is also a `className`.

```
// Two ways to render code tags inline
"This is a <code>className</code>."

This is also a `className`.
```

#### Pre Code

`Pre` code blocks can be rendered by placing three backticks (```) around the beginning and the end of a piece of code. Jekyll uses the [Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) syntax highlighter to render code blocks. You can add a language name after the opening backticks to highlight code in the specified language. You can find a list of supported languages and lexers in the [Rouge Wiki](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers). You can follow [this guide](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/Adding-a-new-lexer) to create custom lexers as well.


```html
<div class="rounded-md bg-swim-dark-blue p-4">
    <div class="flex">
        <div class="flex-shrink-0">
            <svg class="h-8 w-8 text-swim-teal" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true">
                <path fill-rule="evenodd"
                    d="M8.485 2.495c.673-1.167 2.357-1.167 3.03 0l6.28 10.875c.673 1.167-.17 2.625-1.516 2.625H3.72c-1.347 0-2.189-1.458-1.515-2.625L8.485 2.495zM10 5a.75.75 0 01.75.75v3.5a.75.75 0 01-1.5 0v-3.5A.75.75 0 0110 5zm0 9a1 1 0 100-2 1 1 0 000 2z"
                    clip-rule="evenodd" />
            </svg>
        </div>
        <div class="ml-3">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-white mt-1 no_toc">Title</h3>
            <div class="mt-2 text-sm text-white prose-strong:text-swim-blue">
                <p>
                    Example Text.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

You can also just use three backticks to render a non-hilighted code block:

```code
<div class="rounded-md bg-swim-dark-blue p-4">
    <div class="flex">
        <div class="flex-shrink-0">
            <svg class="h-8 w-8 text-swim-teal" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true">
                <path fill-rule="evenodd"
                    d="M8.485 2.495c.673-1.167 2.357-1.167 3.03 0l6.28 10.875c.673 1.167-.17 2.625-1.516 2.625H3.72c-1.347 0-2.189-1.458-1.515-2.625L8.485 2.495zM10 5a.75.75 0 01.75.75v3.5a.75.75 0 01-1.5 0v-3.5A.75.75 0 0110 5zm0 9a1 1 0 100-2 1 1 0 000 2z"
                    clip-rule="evenodd" />
            </svg>
        </div>
        <div class="ml-3">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-white mt-1 no_toc">Title</h3>
            <div class="mt-2 text-sm text-white prose-strong:text-swim-blue">
                <p>
                    Example Text.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
