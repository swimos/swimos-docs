# Reddit Bot Overview

This blog post will explore the use of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swimos/swimos-docs/blob/main/src/_backend/http-lanes.md">HTTP lanes</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swimos/munin">**munin**</a>, a streaming data application built on SwimOS. **munin** is a real-time application that assigns answers to every submission on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbird/">r/WhatsThisBird</a> based on comments. It analyzes most comments internally but also makes external API calls (to eBird.org) for some. The application pushes every derived answer to a PostgreSQL database and interacts with Reddit by posting comments on submissions to display the ongoing analysis.

## Key Functionalities of **munin**

1. **Real-time Categorization of Submissions:**
   - **munin** categorizes r/WhatsThisBird submissions into answered, unanswered, reviewed, and unreviewed, based on the analysis of comments.
   - The categorization is accessible through HTTP lanes and Swim-cli commands, providing detailed insights into each submission.

2. **munin Health Awareness:**
   - **munin** interacts with multiple endpoints, including Reddit's comment and submission fetch endpoints, eBird API, and a PostgreSQL database.
   - The system logs errors and issues encountered during these interactions, offering granular information about the distributed system's health.

## Project Structure

The `swim.munin.swim` package contains Swim-relevant logic for general-purpose Reddit applications. The `swim.munin.filethesebirds` package and its subpackages contain application logic specific to FileTheseBirdsBot. Notice that within this package, there are `swim.munin.filethesebirds.connect` and `swim.munin.filethesebirds.swim` subpackages here that similarly breakdown into general purpose and application-specific implementations.

A design goal of **munin** is to provide a clean separation of concerns and make it easy to support a different subreddit. You'll see that the concrete Web Agents in `swim.munin.filethesebirds.swim` simply extend classes in `swim.munin.swim`, and that while the former depends on the latter, the latter is completely unaware of the former. To make a custom app without FileTheseBirds logic, you only need the latter package.

## **munin** Web Agents at a Glance

1. **`SubmissionsAgent` (Manager of Submissions)**:
   - Acts as an overarching manager for all active subreddit submissions.
   - Categorizes submissions, tracks their status, and manages their lifecycle.
   - Provides HTTP endpoints for external access to submission data, facilitating broader application integration.

2. **`SubmissionAgent` (Individual Submission Handler)**:
   - Each instance manages a specific submission.
   - Tracks detailed information about the submission, including status changes and associated comments.
   - Can be dynamically instantiated as needed, allowing efficient handling of multiple submissions concurrently.

3. **`PublishingAgent` (Comment Interaction Specialist)**:
   - Manages the creation, updating, and deletion of comments on submissions.
   - Handles comment-related interactions in response to changes in the submission's state.
   - Efficiently manages Reddit API constraints through a queuing system.

4. **`CommentsFetchAgent` (Comment Fetcher and Router)**:
   - Fetches new comments and routes them to the relevant `SubmissionAgent`.
   - Filters comments based on submission status (e.g., shelving expired submissions).
   - Operates periodically, ensuring the system is up-to-date with the latest comments.

5. **`SubmissionsFetchAgent` (Initial Submission Acquirer)**:
   - Specialized in fetching new submissions from the subreddit `r/WhatsThisBird`.
   - Inserts updated information about active submissions and shelves submissions that are deleted or removed.
   - Interacts with the vault for data storage, upserting information about active submissions and deleting shelved ones.
   - Uses a command lane to preemptively manage submissions and a timer to schedule regular fetching operations, ensuring timely updates.

## Serving SwimOS Streams as Plain REST Data

Serving real-time SwimOS streams as plain REST data is simple and straight-forward. In SwimOS, an HttpLane is a type of lane that can respond to HTTP requests. This is analogous to a REST endpoint in a traditional web service framework. HTTP lanes are simple and integrate seamlessly with the real-time data handling capabilities of SwimOS. In **munin**, four such lanes are utilized:

- https://munin.swim.services/submissions?lane=api/answered
- https://munin.swim.services/submissions?lane=api/unanswered
- https://munin.swim.services/submissions?lane=api/reviewed
- https://munin.swim.services/submissions?lane=api/unreviewed

Let's look at the flow for `api/unanswered`:

1. HTTP Request Handling:
   - An HTTP GET request is made to https://munin.swim.services/submissions?lane=api/unanswered.
   - The SubmissionsAgent routes this request to the unansweredApiDoRespond method.
2. Data Retrieval and Response:
   - `unansweredApiDoRespond` calls a method in SubmissionsAgentLogic to retrieve the current state of unanswered submissions.
   - The logic determines which submissions are unanswered and formats them as a response.
3. Returning the Response:
   - The formatted data is returned as an HttpResponse object, which is then sent back to the client.

The corresponding code in `SubmissionsAgent` looks like this:

```
@SwimLane("unanswered")
protected MapLane<Long, Value> unanswered = mapLane();

@SwimLane("unreviewed")
protected MapLane<Long, Value> unreviewed = mapLane();

@SwimLane("answered")
protected MapLane<Long, Value> answered = mapLane();

@SwimLane("reviewed")
protected MapLane<Long, Value> reviewed = mapLane();

@SwimLane("api/unanswered")
protected HttpLane<Value> unansweredApi = this.<Value>httpLane()
    .doRespond(this::unansweredApiDoRespond);

@SwimLane("api/unreviewed")
protected HttpLane<Value> unreviewedApi = this.<Value>httpLane()
    .doRespond(this::unreviewedApiDoRespond);

@SwimLane("api/answered")
protected HttpLane<Value> answeredApi = this.<Value>httpLane()
    .doRespond(this::answeredApiDoRespond);

@SwimLane("api/reviewed")
protected HttpLane<Value> reviewedApi = this.<Value>httpLane()
    .doRespond(this::reviewedApiDoRespond);
```

The objective here is to provide an HTTP API endpoint in the `SubmissionsAgent` that, when requested, returns an HTML page listing all unanswered submissions. This is achieved by:

- Delegating the processing of the HTTP request to a specialized logic class (`SubmissionsAgentLogic`), following a clean separation of concerns.
- Utilizing the `unanswered` MapLane in `SubmissionsAgent` to access the relevant data (unanswered submission IDs).
- Dynamically creating an HTML response that formats each unanswered submission as a link.

In the SubmissionsAgent, the call to `unansweredApiDoRespond` is delegated to `SubmissionsAgentLogic`:

- The method `unansweredApiDoRespond` is defined to handle HTTP requests specifically aimed at fetching data about unanswered submissions.
- When an HTTP request is received, this method delegates the processing of the request to `SubmissionsAgentLogic.unansweredApiDoRespond`.


```
  HttpResponse<?> unansweredApiDoRespond(HttpRequest<Value> request) {
    return SubmissionsAgentLogic.unansweredApiDoRespond(this, request);
  }
```

As for the SubmissionsAgentLogic implementation, it performs the following tasks:

1. **HTTP Response Creation (`unansweredApiDoRespond`)**:
   - This static method takes the `SubmissionsAgent` instance and the HTTP request as parameters.
   - It creates an `HttpResponse` object with a status of `HttpStatus.OK`, indicating a successful request.
   - The body of the response is generated by calling the `body` method, which formats the content as HTML.

2. **Data Retrieval and Formatting (`body` Method)**:
   - The `body` method is responsible for formatting the response body.
   - It retrieves the set of IDs (submission IDs) from the `unanswered` lane of the `SubmissionsAgent` using `keySet()`. This set contains the keys (IDs) of all entries in the `unanswered` MapLane.
   - The method iterates over these IDs, creating HTML links for each unanswered submission. The `oneLink` function (not shown in the snippet) presumably formats a single submission ID into an HTML link.
   - The `StringBuilder` accumulates these links, and the resulting string of links is inserted into a format template (`UNANSWERED_PAGE_FMT`), producing the final HTML content.

Here's the code:

```
  static HttpResponse<?> unansweredApiDoRespond(SubmissionsAgent runtime, HttpRequest<Value> request) {
    return HttpResponse.create(HttpStatus.OK)
        .body(body(UNANSWERED_PAGE_FMT, runtime.unanswered.keySet()), MediaType.textHtml());
  }
  
  private static String body(String fmt, Set<Long> ids) {
    final Iterator<Long> itr = ids.iterator();
    String oneLink = oneLink(itr, 1);
    StringBuilder links = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 1; oneLink != null; i++, oneLink = oneLink(itr, i)) {
      links.append(oneLink);
    }
    return String.format(fmt, links.toString());
  }  
```

`SubmissionsAgent` is passed in so that its `unanswered` lane can be accessed using `keySet()` which is exposed by all MapLanes.

## Next Steps

There is a lot more to **munin**, including some insightful technical patterns and practices:

- Consolidation of different read streams into entities (SubmissionAgents).
- Implementation of asynchronous jobs for external API interactions.
- Efficient data pushing to external systems.
- Use of MapLane/ListLane combined with a timer for a throttled work queue.
- Policy-level prevention of bad actor instantiation.
- Dynamic Web Agent state management for cleanup and maintenance.

## Parting Thoughts

**munin** serves as a useful example of implementing a real-time, event-driven application using SwimOS. Its architecture demonstrates how business logic can be seamlessly integrated into a Swim server, providing real-time streaming benefits with minimal effort. The application's interaction with external systems and its ability to perform complex operations efficiently make it a valuable reference for developers looking to take full advantage of SwimOS.
